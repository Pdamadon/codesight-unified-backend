# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the unification and optimization of the CodeSight data collection system. The goal is to merge the crowdsource collector and training collector into a single, efficient pipeline that captures human shopping behavior and converts it directly into high-quality training data for OpenAI fine-tuning.

The unified system will eliminate redundancies, reduce storage costs by 90%+, and create a streamlined pipeline from human behavior capture to AI model training.
