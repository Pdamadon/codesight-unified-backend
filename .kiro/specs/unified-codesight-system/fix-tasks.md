# Application Fix Tasks - FOCUSED

## Overview

After analysis, the unified CodeSight system is **90% implemented**! We have all major services, routes, middleware, and utilities. The issues are primarily small import/export mismatches and missing method implementations.

## Actual Issues Identified

### 1. Import/Export Mismatches ‚ö†Ô∏è 
- Server imports `StorageManager` from `storage-manager-clean.ts` but expects different interface
- Some services reference methods that don't exist on other services
- TypeScript type mismatches between service interfaces

### 2. Missing Method Implementations üîß
- Some services reference methods on other services that aren't implemented
- A few interface methods are declared but not implemented

### 3. TypeScript Configuration Issues üìù
- Some implicit `any` types need explicit typing
- JWT signing options need proper typing

## Risk Mitigation

### High Risk Items
1. **OpenAI API Integration** - Complex external dependency
   - Mitigation: Create mock service for development
   - Fallback: Implement basic functionality first

2. **Database Performance** - Large data volumes
   - Mitigation: Implement proper indexing
   - Fallback: Add caching layer

3. **WebSocket Scalability** - Real-time requirements
   - Mitigation: Implement connection pooling
   - Fallback: Use polling as backup

### Medium Risk Items
1. **File Storage Costs** - S3 usage
   - Mitigation: Implement compression
   - Fallback: Local storage option

2. **Test Complexity** - Performance testing
   - Mitigation: Start with simple tests
   - Fallback: Manual testing procedures

## Next Steps

1. **Start with Phase 1** - Foundation infrastructure
2. **Create development environment** - Docker setup
3. **Implement in priority order** - Critical items first
4. **Test incrementally** - Don't wait until the end
5. **Document as you go** - Keep track of decisions

This plan provides a systematic approach to fixing all issues and making the application fully functional.
