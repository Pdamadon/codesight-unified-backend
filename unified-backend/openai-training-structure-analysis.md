# Redesigned Training Data Structure

## PROMPT:

```
[USER GOAL]
Navigate and complete user goal

[JOURNEY]
Step: 3/4
Progress: homepage → navigation → [interaction] → completion
Task: Interact with "Athletic & Sneakers" to progress from interaction to completion

[DOM CONTEXT]
Element: <a href="/browse/men/shoes/sneakers-athletic?breadcrumb=Home%2FMen%2FShoes%2FAthletic%20%26%20Sneakers&origin=topnav" class="ZDzTL _3njsS ayGrI">Athletic & Sneakers</a>
Bounding Box: {x: 501.3359375, y: 247.09375, width: 134.8046875, height: 24}

[SPATIAL CONTEXT]
Left: "Shoes" (57px), "Boots" (58px)
Below: "Comfort" (78px)
Above: "Men" (88px)

[SELECTORS]
1. //nav[@id='GlobalDesktopNavFlyout']/div/div/div/div/ul[3]/li[2]/a (0.70)
2. #GlobalDesktopNavFlyout > div.ZAHWm.k75rT > div.U_Vu3.dx7Ke > div.aXrua > div.UYr2M.fWRC1 > ul.L9PTf:nth-of-type(3) > li.Bn6xe.m_qRs:nth-of-type(2) > a.ZDzTL._3njsS
3. .ZDzTL._3njsS.ayGrI
```

## COMPLETION:

```
[ACTION]
Interact

[SELECTOR]
//nav[@id='GlobalDesktopNavFlyout']/div/div/div/div/ul[3]/li[2]/a

[REASONING]
XPath selector with moderate DOM stability - This action progresses the user journey toward: Navigate and complete user goal

[CONFIDENCE]
0.70

[JOURNEY IMPACT]
Current Step: Interaction
Next Step: Completion
Goal Progress: 75%
Expected Outcome: Complete interaction and advance to completion

[FALLBACKS]
1. #GlobalDesktopNavFlyout > div.ZAHWm.k75rT > div.U_Vu3.dx7Ke > div.aXrua > div.UYr2M.fWRC1 > ul.L9PTf:nth-of-type(3) > li.Bn6xe.m_qRs:nth-of-type(2) > a.ZDzTL._3njsS
2. .ZDzTL._3njsS.ayGrI

[COORDINATES]
{x: 501.3359375, y: 247.09375}

# Explanation

1. **Information Architecture**: The data is organized into clear, labeled sections. This makes it easier for the AI to understand the context and hierarchy of the information.

2. **Prompt Structure**: The prompt is simplified and structured, making it easier for the AI to understand the task at hand.

3. **Completion Format**: The completion is structured text, which is easier for the AI to generate and understand than complex JSON.

4. **Section Organization**: The sections are grouped by type of context (User Goal, Journey, DOM Context, Spatial Context, Selectors), which helps the AI understand the relationship between different pieces of information.

5. **Learning Efficiency**: The simplified and structured format will help the AI learn faster and more reliably. The clear labeling of sections and prioritization of information will also help the AI understand the task and generate correct responses.

# Recommendations

1. **Simplify and structure your data**: The clearer and more structured your data, the easier it will be for the AI to learn.

2. **Label your sections**: This helps the AI understand the context and hierarchy of the information.

3. **Prioritize your information**: Put the most important information first to help the AI understand the task.

4. **Use structured text for completion**: This is easier for the AI to generate and understand than complex JSON.

5. **Group sections by context**: This helps the AI understand the relationship between different pieces of information.

# Additional Insights

1. **Consistency is key**: The more consistent your data, the easier it will be for the AI to learn.

2. **Avoid redundancy**: Redundant information can confuse the AI and slow down learning.

3. **Keep it simple**: The simpler your data, the faster and more reliably the AI will learn.
